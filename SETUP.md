# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide for EduBoost Health Model

## ðŸ“¥ Getting Started

Since the trained model file is too large for GitHub (244MB), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thilan071/edu-portal-health-model-.git
cd edu-portal-health-model-
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Train the Model
```bash
# This will create the eduboost_health_recommendation_model.pkl file
python train_model.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Model
```bash
# Run accuracy evaluation
python accuracy_evaluation.py

# Try example usage
python example_usage.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Get

After training, you'll have a model with:
- **93.8% Overall Accuracy**
- **100% Real-world Test Accuracy** 
- **76.6% Average RÂ² Score**

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Use Without Trained Model

The system works even without the trained model file:

```python
from eduboost_health_model import EduBoostHealthModel

# Will use built-in heuristics if no model file exists
model = EduBoostHealthModel(verbose=True)

result = model.predict(
    mood='Stressed',
    stress_level=4, 
    procrastination_level=3,
    sleep_hours=6.5
)
```

## ðŸ“Š Training Information

- **Dataset**: 100,000 student health records
- **Training Time**: ~2-3 minutes on modern hardware
- **Model Size**: 244MB (Random Forest ensemble)
- **Accuracy**: 93.8% across all health metrics

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Model file missing
**Solution**: Run `python train_model.py`

**Issue**: Import errors  
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Dataset not found
**Solution**: Ensure `.github/health_model/health_check_100k_dataset.csv` exists

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed
2. Verify the dataset file exists
3. Run the training script to generate the model
4. Use verbose mode for detailed logging

Happy modeling! ðŸŽ“
